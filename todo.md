## TODO
* Maintain Silex
* Localization (twig, controller, php, js)
* Sometimes, I try to upload a file like `grub.png` and it does not work, while I upload a different `.png` and it works, weird
* make sure new functions work with Windows or disable some features is Windows
* treegraph pager
* diff by file
* pager not working right with commits
* search has no pager (either of two)
* Basically, the twig "for" is not cheap => expensive, use AJAX and web worker 
  * search.twig
  * blame.twig
* Search, at work, "fix" string has 1221 results, use AJAX and pager
* Blames in gitlist on composer.lock has 994 results, use AJAX and pager
* In submodules, if the "submodule" and "path" is not the same, it chokes (it should work the submodule name and path are not the same)
  * Works
    * submodule "path/name"
    * path path/name
  * Not working
    * submodule "name"
    * path path/name 
* In submodules, the url cannot have slash at the end

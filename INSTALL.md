# GitList Installation
* Download GitList from [https://github.com/patrikx3/gitlist/releases](https://github.com/patrikx3/gitlist/releases/) and decompress to your `/var/www/gitlist` folder, or anywhere else you want to place GitList.
* Rename the `config.example.ini-example` file to `config.ini`.
* Open up the `config.ini` and configure your installation. You'll have to provide where your repositories are located and the base GitList URL.
* Create the cache folder and give read/write permissions to your web server user:

```bash
cd /var/www/gitlist
mkdir -p cache
chmod 777 cache
```

That's it, installation complete!

## Webserver configuration

Apache is the "default" webserver for GitList. You will find the configuration inside the `.htaccess` file. However, nginx and lighttpd are also supported.

To make it to be more secure:
All `PHP` files will be in the `root` and only `index.php`, `images`, `icons`, `svg`, `css`, `js`bundle files will be in the `public` subdir.

### nginx server.conf

```conf
server {
    server_name MYSERVER;
    access_log /var/log/nginx/MYSERVER.access.log combined;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/MYSERVER.error.log error;

    root /var/www/DIR/public;
    index index.php;

#   auth_basic "Restricted";
#   auth_basic_user_file .htpasswd;

    location = /robots.txt {
        allow all;
        log_not_found off;
        access_log off;
    }

    location ~* ^/index.php.*$ {
        fastcgi_index index.php;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;

        # if you're using php7.2-fpm via socket
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php7.2-fpm.sock;

        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
    	include      snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
    	fastcgi_pass $php_listener;
    }
    
    location ~ /\.ht {
     deny all;
    }	

    location ~* \.(js|css|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|ico)$ {
    add_header Vary "Accept-Encoding";
        expires max;
        try_files $uri @gitlist;
        tcp_nodelay off;
        tcp_nopush on;
    }

#   location ~* \.(git|svn|patch|htaccess|log|route|plist|inc|json|pl|po|sh|ini|sample|kdev4)$ {
#       deny all;
#   }

 
}
```



### lighthttpd

I do not use `lighthttpd`, but you know what I mean. Make sure only, the `gitlist/public` folder should be enabled.

```txt
# GitList is located in /var/www/gitlist/
server.document-root        = "/var/www"

url.rewrite-once = (
    "^/gitlist/web/.+" => "$0",
    "^/gitlist/favicon\.ico$" => "$0",
    "^/gitlist(/[^\?]*)(\?.*)?" => "/gitlist/index.php$1$2"
)
```

### hiawatha

I do not use `hiawatha`, but you know what I mean. Make sure only, the `gitlist/public` folder should be enabled.


```txt
UrlToolkit {
    ToolkitID = gitlist
    RequestURI isfile Return
    # If you have example.com/gitlist/ ; Otherwise remove "/gitlist" below
    Match ^/gitlist/.* Rewrite /gitlist/index.php
    Match ^/gitlist/.*\.ini DenyAccess
}
```
